\section{Choice of RX topology}

\IEEEPARstart{F}{or} the receiver we made several choices with regard to what topology and types of elements to use. The general topology we chose to use for the receiver is depicted in figure \ref{fig:topology}.

The choice of topology is based on the work in ~\cite{mahony2010a}.
