\subsection{Performance results of final link}

The link simulated without any bit errors over \unit[5000]{UI} at \unit[2]{Gb/s} at \unit[1]{V}. For \unit[10]{Gb/s} at \unit[0.7]{V} we got 43 bit errors on the 5000 bits woth is clearly not sufficient. We assume that this is still the common mode problem of the track-and-hold described in section \ref{sec:link_opt} and that increasing the track-and.hold capacitor size would resolve these errors. However, due to our limited disk space quota we were not able to run more simulations on that and solve the problem.
