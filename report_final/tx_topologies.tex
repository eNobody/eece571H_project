\subsection{Choice of the circuit topology}

A specified for this assignment we need to design a:

\textit{Low-power supply-scalable (0.7-1.0V) I/O Link operating at 2-10Gb/s with at
least 2-tap voltage-mode TX. Minimize energy efficiency of the link, with an upper target
of 1pJ/b at 10Gb/s. }

So for the TX driver we first of all need to design a VM driver, for this we've chosen to use a slice topology in order to obtain a differential TX driver with equalization and tunable impedance.

For the TX driver we've decided to design for the topology depicted in figure \ref{fig:topology_tx}, where the serializer is responsible for serializing the input data to the transmitter, the two signals on each bus from the serializer to the TX driver is the cursor and the first post-cursor, the post-cursor is needed for serialization. The clock is a half-rate clock and thus it has two lines to the driver and serializer. The TX driver is as mentioned a slice design, where we've decided on using 12 slices in total, 9 for the cursor and 3 slices for the post-cursor. The reason we've decided to split up the allocation of slices is that this will lower the load for the pre-drivers.

The topology design is based on the half-rate transmitter design from ~\cite{menolfi2007a}, also depicted in figure \ref{fig:topology1}, we will however only feature one tap with a known sign, which will result in a simpler architecture.

The slice design we're going to use is based on the design used in ~\cite{menolfi2007a}, also depicted in figure \ref{fig:topology0}, as this is a slice designed for half-rate clocking operation hence very fitting to the design choices we made earlier.
